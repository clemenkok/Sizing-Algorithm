# Sizing-Algorithm

This Algorithm implements a computational method of the Sizing command used in military parades.

The Sizing Command is used to sort a formation of m x n people into a new formation such that their heights descend inward and backward. This helps to make parade formations neater for the audience. An example can be found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3D_cg4G5yg.

This Algorithm is inspired by the steps used in that command to sort a matrix of random values into a new matrix that likewise has descending value as one goes inwards. The steps, in footdrill, are mimicked as code.

It is imagined that there may be a more efficient implementation that we can find using computation, which can then be later applied to real-world footdrill. That is the objective of this repository.

An alternative implementation in Python can be found at https://github.com/lsyurea/different-sorting-algorithms.

Further work includes extending the implementation to rows of >3 ranks; the above implementation works only for formations of 3 ranks.
