# Sizing-Algorithm

This Algorithm implements a computational method of the Sizing command used in military parades.

The Sizing Command is used to sort a formation of m x n people into a new formation such that their heights descend inward and backward. This helps to make parade formations neater for the audience.

This Algorithm is inspired by the steps used in that command to sort a matrix of random values into a new matrix that likewise has descending value as one goes inwards. The steps, in footdrill, are mimicked as code.

It is imagined that there may be a more efficient implementation that we can find using computation, which can then be later applied to real-world footdrill. That is the objective of this repository.

An alternative implementation in Python can be found at https://github.com/lsyurea/different-sorting-algorithms.
